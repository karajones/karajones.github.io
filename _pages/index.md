<h3>Hello!</h3>

I'm a biologist currently finishing up my PhD focusing on phylogenetics, population genetics, and phylogeography of the *Desmognathus quadramaculatus* salamander species complex. I'm really passionate about improving science education and the accessibility of scientific knowledge for everyone. The picture above shows me and my friend Phidippus from one of my cross-species outreach events.

The tutorials are being updated and will be reposted soon, so check back if you need some help with bioinformatics, R, GIS, and fun stuff like that. I have a general audience blog about biology and natural history, <a href="http://unlovedcreatures.com">Unloved Creatures</a>, which I'm starting to update again. I've been kind of distracted by this whole dissertation thing. :squirrel:
