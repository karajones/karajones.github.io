<h3>Hello!</h3>

I'm a biologist focused on conservation genetics. I have research experience in a variety of related fields, incuding phylogenetics, population genetics, phylogeography, and metagenomics. I'm also passionate about improving science education and the accessibility of scientific knowledge for everyone. My current projects include:

- Assessing the available molecular resources for environmental DNA metabarcoding of Nearctic bees
- Using eDNA to monitor pollinator communities in the Western US 
- Characterizing community assemblages of marine organisms off the coast of Hawai'i
