## Some other stuff I've done...

Here are a few of the things I did before I figured out getting a college degree was a good idea. (It took me a while.) Is any of this relevant to my current career? Hmmm, maybe? Is it relevant to who I am and how I view the world? Probably.

Updated website and created project management system for the mining department

**2005: Personal Assistant to the Director, Momtaz Islamic Art Gallery, London, United Kingdom** \
Designed and implementing new product and contact database

**2004: Adventurer (i.e., I went backpacking!)**  \
Mostly Europe (so maybe not *that* adventurous?)

**2002-2003: Freelance Graphic/Web Design Artist**  \
Designed websites and advertisements for small businesses

**2002: Resident Associate Volunteer, Smithsonian Natural History Museum, Washington, DC**  \
Maintained database of research articles for the Wilson Copepod Library 

**2000-2001: Grocery Department Head Manager, Takoma Park Cooperative, Takoma Park, MD**  \
