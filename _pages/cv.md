My current focus is on phylogenetics, population genetics, phylogeography, and associated fields. That all sounds fancy, but the questions I've been focusing on in my research are ultimately pretty basic: Where do things live? Why do they live there? And where are they going to be able to live in the future?

## Some other stuff I've done...

Here are a few of the things I did before I figured out getting a college degree was a good idea. (It took me a while.) Is any of this relevant to my current career? Hmmm, maybe? Is it relevant to who I am and how I view the world? Probably.
