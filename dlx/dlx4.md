### Moving your stuff around

> Summary:
> 1. Use `mv` to move a file or directory to a new location
> 2. Use `mv` to rename a file or directory
> 2. Use `cp` to make a copy of a file in a new location
> 3. Use `cp -r` to make a copy of a directory
> 4. Use `mkdir` to make a new directory
> 5. Use `rm` to remove a file, `rm -r` to remove a directory, and `rmdir` to remove an empty directory


Now that you have some files uploaded to the DLX, you might want to move them around and organize them. The four basic commands youâ€™ll need are `mv` (move), `cp` (copy), `mkdir` (make directory), and `rm` (remove). 

> Note: *There is no command for renaming files and directories*. If you want to rename something, then you will have to move or copy it. See below for instructions.
---- 
#### Moving files and directories
Moving files will move a file from one location to another. The file will no longer exist in the original location.

I want to move `things.txt` to my `packages` directory:
	mv things.txt packages

I want to rename `things.txt` to `stuff.txt` and move it to my `packages` directory:
	mv things.txt packages/stuff.txt

I want to rename `things.txt` to `stuff.txt` *without moving it anywhere*:
	mv things.txt stuff.txt

I want to move my `packages` directory into my `stuff` directory, which lives in my `home` directory:
	mv packages ~/stuff

> Caution: When you `mv` directories, you do *not* need to use a `-r` (recursive) command. You will need it to copy folders, though.
---- 
#### Copying files and directories
Copying files will place a copy of a file from one location into another location. The file will still exist in the original location. The commands are similar to `mv`, except when it comes to copying directories.

I want to place a copy of `things.txt` in my `packages` directory:
	cp things.txt packages/.

I want to rename `things.txt` to `stuff.txt` and place a copy of it in my `packages` directory:
	cp things.txt packages/stuff.txt

I want to rename `things.txt` to `stuff.txt` *without moving it anywhere*. This will leave you with two identical files (with different names) in the same directory:
	cp things.txt stuff.txt

I want to place a copy of my `packages` directory in my `stuff` directory, which lives in my home directory:
	cp -r packages ~/stuff
---- 
#### Making directories
Need a new directory? No problem, just use the command `mkdir` and give your directory a name.

I want a new directory named `awesome`:
	mkdir awesome
---- 
#### Removing files and directories
> Warning: Removing files and directories is permanent. Make sure you are absolutely sure you want to delete the file or directory before you use this command. You will *not* be able to recover your work.

I want to remove a file called `things.txt`:
	rm things.txt

I want to remove a directory called `awesome`:
	rm -r awesome

I want to remove a directory called `awesome` that has nothing in it:
	rmdir awesome
